# COMPONENTS
Separate components by folders preferrably grouped by their pages. Folder names should be in kebab-case

Each folder should have an index.vue file that will serve as the main component. Other components should be named using PascalCase

Ex:
 /components
  /page-1
   /panel-1
    - index.vue
   /panel-2
    - index.vue
    - SubPanel2.vue
  /page-2
   /panel-1
    - index.vue
